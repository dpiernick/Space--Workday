# Space--Workday

Hi! Thanks for checking out my "Space!" project!

I've left some notes below on my approach to building this project as well as how to run it. Looking forward to hearing what you think!

Thanks,

Dave


## Notes on Development and Architechture
I built the search view and results table in UIKit, and the results cells and detail view in SwiftUI.
I used async/await wherever possible. I love how it reads as if synchronous code and I feel it's more straightforward to test
I used MVVM Architecture Pattern to keep UI and Functionality separate
It seems like I'm getting a few strange messages in the console.
Given more time Iâ€™d investigate the cause and get those to stop displaying, but no current issues with functionality
Please let me know what you think!
